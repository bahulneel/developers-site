The connect page is where you can get the details for connecting an app to Fluree Nexus via HTTP or Node.js.
You have access to a connection string and the ability to generate an api key to permission your connection to your dataset.
It's important to note that the key should be kept private and stored in a secure location - it is **not** surfaceable after it has been generated.
Use the API key in your HTTP request Authorization headers as Bearer: `API_KEY`.
