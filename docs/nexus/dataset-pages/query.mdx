The query page is where you can query the data in your dataset. You can toggle between using `FlureeQL`, `GraphQL`, `SPARQL`, or `SQL`.
You also have the ability to save your queries, to the right of the query editor you can locate recent queries and saved queries.

<!--## Charts and Tables

The query page also offers different ways of visualizing your data, though there are certain key properties your queries will need to include.

For viewing data in the chart view you will be to use the `groupBy` property in your analytical query. This will allow the UI to determine which fields to group together in order to make a chart.

An example would be the following query:

```json
{
  "select": [
    "(count ?car)"
  ],
  "where": [
    [
      "?car",
      "cars/model_make_id",
      "?model"
    ]
  ]
  "groupBy": "?model"
}
```

For viewing data in the table view you will need to use variable binding on more than one variable, for more information visit [tuple variable bindings](https://developers.flur.ee/docs/overview/query/analytical_query/#two-tuple-variable-binding).
The bindings will then be formatted into the headers of your table.

An example would be the following query:

```json
{
  "select": ["?name", "?type"],
  "where": [
    ["?predicate", "rdf:type", "_predicate"],
    ["?predicate", "_predicate/name", "?name"],
    ["?predicate", "_predicate/type", "?type"]
  ]
}
```

## Advanced Queries

The Nexus app can determine what type of query you are making based on the clauses provided. Currently, in addition to standard & analytical queries, **block** and **history** queries are supported in FlureeQL.

### Block Queries

If a `block` clause is provided without a `select`, `selectOne`, `selectDistinct`, `from`, `where`, or `history` clause, a _block_ query will be attempted. [Click here for a more detailed look at block queries](/docs/guides/querying/query-advanced/1.md)

### History Queries

If a `history` clause is provided without a `select`, `selectOne`, `selectDistinct`, `from`, or `where` clause, a _history_ query will be attempted. [Click here for a more detailed look at history queries](/docs/guides/querying/query-advanced/3.md)
