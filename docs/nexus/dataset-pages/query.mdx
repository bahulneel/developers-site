The query page is where you can query the data in your dataset. You can toggle between using `FlureeQL`, `GraphQL`, `SPARQL`, or `SQL`.
You also have the ability to save your queries, to the right of the query editor you can locate recent queries and saved queries.

## Charts and Tables

The query page also offers different ways of visualizing your data, though there are certain key properties your queries will need to include.

For viewing data in the chart view you will be to use the `groupBy` property in your analytical query. This will allow the UI to determine which fields to group together in order to make a chart.

An example would be the following query:

```json
{
  "select": [
    "(count ?car)"
  ],
  "where": [
    [
      "?car",
      "cars/model_make_id",
      "?model"
    ]
  ]
  "groupBy": "?model"
}
```

For viewing data in the table view you will need to use variable binding on more than one variable, for more information visit [tuple variable bindings](https://developers.flur.ee/docs/overview/query/analytical_query/#two-tuple-variable-binding).
The bindings will then be formatted into the headers of your table.

An example would be the following query:

```json
{
  "select": ["?name", "?type"],
  "where": [
    ["?predicate", "rdf:type", "_predicate"],
    ["?predicate", "_predicate/name", "?name"],
    ["?predicate", "_predicate/type", "?type"]
  ]
}
```
