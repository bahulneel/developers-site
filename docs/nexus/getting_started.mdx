Once the dataset is successfully created you'll be routed to the overview page of your dataset.

## Adding data

Adding data in Fluree Nexus can be done on the transact page of your dataset. All transactions need to be nested in square brackets `[]` and are written in FlureeQL.
For an in depth explanation about transcting in Fluree Nexus refer to the [transact page](https://developers.flur.ee/docs/nexus/dataset-pages/transact/) documentation.
